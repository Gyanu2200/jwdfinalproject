**Explain your storyboards / Design choices / Bootstrap components used**
- We used wireframe to design our blue print for the project, we found it easier to use. We bootstrap nav bar, form and card for task, because it gives us the form field that we required, with inbuilt basic design. 

**How Git and GitHub were used effectively to sync files between team members**
-Created repo
-Assigned collaborator
-Created different branches: used : clone, new branch, add, commit, push, log, pull request, review, commment, merge, status, fetch, pull


**Flow of the project code in VSCode** 
- HTML => CSS => taskManager.js => index.js
- liveshare, console, application, local storage
 
**Researching and finding effective solutions** - 
- use of walkthrough guideline repo provided by instructor
- use of youtube, w3school, Mozilla developer (MDN)
- advice from peers and instructor

**What did you learn from your experiences?**
